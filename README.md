## To Do:

- Use the GitHub APIs to collect and store the comments data in a more robust structure (and make the corresponding parsing changes)
- Optimize the code and maybe store the comments in a database
- Add data to the comment list (parent comment, post title, author email etc), and change the styling (typography, follow netfliyâ€™s style guidelines etc)
- Add checkbox functionality to make bulk actions (approve multiple comments, but not all of them etc)
